### Objective of this exercise
Develop an app using Android and another using ionic. <br>
Both have the same functionalities and the point is to compare both tecnologies. <br>
This app makes use of webservices (http://207.38.82.139/seminar/doc/) and  <br> 
access to devices resources, like bluetooth and internet access.

### Pre-requisites
Android-studio 2.3 <br>
Android SDK >= 1.7 <br>
Ionic 2 <br>


### Android App
We divided in two types of users: students and teachers. <br>
The students can confirm their presence on the seminars and change theirs account information. <br>
The teacher can do more: besides editing their profile, they can add/edit/delete seminars, <br>
send confirmation of the students presence on the seminars to the server. <br>
So, some functionalities of the system that teachers have access are hidden from the students. <br>

The HttpUtil file encapsulate the post and get requests. So we can use it several times in the code.<br>

One way to confirm a student presence is using bluetooth. <br>

## Libraries

We are using to this project the zxing library (to do QR-Code readings) and <br>
volley (HTTP library to help us with the requests). <br>
